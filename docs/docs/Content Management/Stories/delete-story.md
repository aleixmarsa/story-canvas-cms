Only **administrators** are allowed to delete stories.

## How to Delete a **Story**

### 1. Go to the Stories page

Navigate to:  
`/admin/dashboard/stories`

---

### 2. Open the action menu

Locate the story you want to delete in the list.  
Click the **three dots (···)** at the end of the row to open the **action menu**.

---

### 3. Click "Delete"

From the dropdown, select **`Delete`**.

A **confirmation modal** will appear asking if you're sure you want to delete the story.

> This step helps prevent accidental deletion.

---

### 4. Confirm the deletion

In the modal, click **`Delete`** to proceed.

The story will be deleted immediately.

---

## Undo Deletion (3 seconds window)

After deletion, a **notification** appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

- It confirms that the story has been deleted.
- You have **3 seconds** to click `Undo` and restore the story.

> After that time, the deletion becomes permanent and cannot be reversed.


## Notes

- Deleting a story will also remove all its associated **draft and published sections**.
- The deletion action is only available from the `/admin/dashboard/stories` page.
